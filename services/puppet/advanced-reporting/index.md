Overview
---

Does your organization manage hundreds of thousands of nodes (or more) with
Puppet? Do you find that the performance of reporting tooling like PuppetDB or Puppet
Enterprise is unable to keep up with the scale of your managed fleet?

At Open Infrastructure, we have designed and implemented advanced Puppet reporting
solutions that track thousands of Puppet resources across millions of daily Puppet
runs.

With our advanced reporting solution, your organization can:

- Visualize the enforcement of a specific Puppet code change by graphing individual Puppet resource changes on a time/series chart.
- Provide compliance data for auditors by charting the progress of a specific Puppet code change commit SHA across the managed fleet.
- Identify problematic Puppet code and prioritize fixes by aggregating and stack-ranking fleet-wide resource failures.
- Reduce the amount of time spent performing root-cause analysis through powerful time-based filtering.

Contact us today to discuss the reporting problems your organization is facing
and how we can help!
