Open Infrastructure Services formed in 2015 by founding members of Puppet
Inc.'s professional services team.  We have extensive experience designing,
implementing, and maintaining Puppet deployments from the scale of small startups
to many hundreds of thousands of nodes.

You've likely seen the talks we delivered at Puppetconfs/Puppetcamps, the
public/private training courses we've presented, online answering questions in
channels on the <a href="https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/">Puppet Community
Slack</a>, or even as a co-author of the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Puppet-Experts-Voice-Open-Source/dp/1430230576/">Pro
Puppet book</a>.

Contact us to implement the following advanced services for your organization.
