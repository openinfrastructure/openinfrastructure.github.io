Overview
---

At Open Infrastructure, we specialize in providing Terraform services for the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Our team of experts can help you leverage the power
of Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and management on GCP,
enabling you to deploy and scale your applications faster and more reliably.

We offer a range of Terraform services for GCP, including:

Module Development
---

Allow us to help you develop Terraform modules that encapsulate reusable
infrastructure components, such as network configurations, security policies,
and more. This can help you streamline your infrastructure provisioning and make
it easier to scale and manage your infrastructure as your application grows.

Code Structure and Layout
---

The fastest way to brittle, painful Terraform deployments is a repository full
of poorly structured code. We have experienced this pain first hand so that you
don't have to! We will audit your codebase and make recommendations for code
structure, data separation, and state management that will increase the
predictability of your Terraform deployments.

Deployment Automation
---

We can help you automate your Terraform deployments to streamline your
development process and ensure consistency across your infrastructure.
This includes:

* Setting up automated Terraform plan executions to ensure that all infrastructure changes are validated before they are deployed.
* Enabling Terraform pull request automation to ensure that approved code changes are immediately deployed.
* Locking down deployment credentials to ensure they're governed with the principle of least privilege.

By automating your Terraform deployments, you can reduce the risk of human error
and ensure that your infrastructure is always in a consistent state, regardless
of the size or complexity of your environment.
