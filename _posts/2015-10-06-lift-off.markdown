I'm pleased to announce Open Infrastructure Services, LLC is open for business!
Here's some information about myself and the services I have available.  Please
[email][email-me] me with any questions about how I can help.

Open Infrastructure Services is founded by me, [Jeff McCune][jeff], a veteran
systems administrator and software developer with over 15 years of experience.
Before starting my consulting business I was at [Puppet Labs][puppetlabs] as a software
developer working on [Puppet][puppet], [Facter][facter], [Puppet
Server][puppet-server], and other internal tools like
[crossfader](https://github.com/puppetlabs/crossfader).  Prior to that, I was a
professional services engineer at Puppet Labs, traveling the world working with
customers and the open source community on matters of system architecture,
availability, security, and continuous delivery workflows.

While traveling for Puppet Labs, I also co-authored [Pro Puppet][pro-puppet], the
best-selling book about how to quickly get started and then scale Puppet toward
full automation.

Before Puppet Labs I worked at [Netsmart Technologies][ntst] where I was
responsible for our hosted SaaS datacenters.  Puppet and DevOps practices
played a key part of my success at Netsmart.  We were able to implement SAS-70
II compliance in a matter of months using a well defined change management
process, and detailed automated reports integrated with Puppet and [Splunk][splunk].

Prior to Netsmart Technologies, I worked at the Mathematics Department at Ohio
State University.  There, I learned about automation, [cfengine][cfengine],
started using [Puppet][puppet], and fully automated our Mac OS X workstations
and labs.  In order to achieve full automation for PowerPC and Intel based
systems, I reverse engineered Apple's boot service discovery protocol and
patched ISC DHCP to behave as an automated network boot server for Mac OS X.  I
presented on Puppet at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference.

Please [contact me][contact] if you have a need for professional, intelligent
and creative solutions to the infrastructure problems that are holding you back
from delivering your applications.
