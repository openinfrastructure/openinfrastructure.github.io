Open Infrastructure Services is growing!  I'm excited to announce [Gary
Larizza][gary], has joined Open Infrastructure Services as a Principal
Consultant.  Gary and I first started working together on Puppet back in 2010 in
Portland, Oregon.  From that first day working together I was struck by Gary's
attitude and desire to dive deep in the guts of Puppet to figure out what's
_really_ going on.  Fast forward to 2017, and I've found myself visiting [Shit
Gary Says][garyblog] on a daily basis while working on Puppet types and
providers.  Gary's ability to assimilate complex information, distill that
information into the essential bits customers value, and communicate that
essential information with humor and empathy has been invaluable to me
personally.  A great example of this depth, humor, and empathy is, [Seriously,
what is this provider doing?][garyprovider]

Gary and I both started out working in education in Ohio, though separately from
one another.  We were bought together in Portland, OR by two australians from
the other side of the world, Nigel Kersten and James Turnbull.

Gary and I share that special bond that only comes from successfully dealing
with a classroom full of computers delivered a couple of weeks before school
starts with the latest and greatest Mac OS X major release, chock full of
changes and new surprises.

Please check out Gary's post, [Some Other Beginning's End][garypost] on this new
beginning for both of us.

[Contact][contact] us with your automation and cloud infrastructure goals.  We'd
both love to help you handle changes faster and more confidently through
automated cloud infrastructure.

Gary is also a [Puppet][puppet] certified consultant and a member of the Puppet
Services Delivery Partner Program.  We're here to help achieve your goals
whether you're expanding your Puppet investment, upgrading to the latest version
and language features, or just getting started.
