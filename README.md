# Open Infrastructure Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. See https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#running-the-development-server for more information on getting started and running a development server.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

We're using a Cloudflare Pages deployment to deploy the site. Visit Cloudflare's "Workers and Pages" overview for more information on that deployment.
