- **During a change to Open Infrastructure Services’s business.** If Open Infrastructure Services is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or bankruptcy, your Personal Information would be an asset transferred to or acquired by the successor entity or third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may process Personal Information in a manner different to that set out in this Privacy Policy.

In all such instances, use and disclosure will be limited as much as reasonably possible.

### Legal Basis for Processing

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in the above sections will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, in most cases we collect the personal information to facilitate the business relationships we have with our Users where we have consent to do so, to fulfill contractual agreements, or to pursue our legitimate interests where these are not overridden by the interests, rights, or freedoms of Users. In some cases we may be required legally to collect or disclose personal information; in which case we will make this clear. In other cases, where we rely on an alternative legal basis, we will do so only with the appropriate legal requirements in place. For any questions on our legal basis for processing , please contact us at privacy@openinfrastructure.co.

- **Service providers, business partners, and subprocessors.** Service providers, business partners, and subprocessors all help to support Open Infrastructure Services’s products and operations.
- **To comply with laws.** If we receive a valid request for information, we may disclose Personal Information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required to comply with the legal process, a government request, or any applicable law or regulation.

## How long do we keep your data?

We only process and keep any Personal Information for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose for which the information was originally collected. The exact length of time we keep Personal Information depends on our processing purposes and the statutory retention period for that type of information.

For international transfers of personal data, we implement measures as necessary to ensure we provide appropriate safeguards for the transferred personal data by using one of the following approaches:

- We may enter into agreements with Standard Contractual Clauses or another lawful transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission, and as agreed with customers.
- We may transfer personal data to countries with privacy laws that have been recognized by the country from which the data was transferred as providing similar data protections (“adequacy”).

This applies only to Open Infrastructure Services practices, technologies, and services. This does not include links to websites and online services that are operated by other companies not under the control or direction of Open Infrastructure Services. If you provide or submit personal information to those websites or online services, the privacy policies on those websites or online services apply to your personal information. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of any website you visit.

## Your Rights

We recognize, under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, CCPA, the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD), and other applicable privacy laws, that you may have certain rights in regards to your Personal Information. We feel that your privacy and ability to preserve and exercise your rights is very important. You are encouraged to review and understand these rights as they pertain to you and your Personal Information. In certain circumstances, these rights include, but are not limited to:

- **Right to be Informed**: This means we have to tell you why we process your Personal Information, our retention periods, and who it will be shared with.
- **Right of Access**: This means we have to provide you with a copy of your Personal Information we process upon your request.
- **Right to Rectification**: This allows you to have inaccurate Personal Information rectified, or completed if it is incomplete.
- **Right to Erasure**: This allows you to have your Personal Information erased.
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: This means you can limit the way we use their data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: This allows you to receive a copy of your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and gives you the right to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance.
- **Right to Object**: This allows you to object to the processing of your Personal Information at any time.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination**: The CCPA prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers for exercising their CCPA rights. This means we cannot charge a different price, deny access to our products, or impose penalties for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent**: This means you can withdraw your consent at any time.

In support of these rights, you may exercise any of the above rights, with respect to your Personal Information. You may update, correct, or delete your Personal Information; if you wish to delete or suspend your account, please note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. If you have become aware that an account has been created about you without your knowledge or consent, you may contact us to request deletion of that said account by emailing privacy@openinfrastructure.co

For your protection, we may only respond with the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will respond to your request within 30 days.
