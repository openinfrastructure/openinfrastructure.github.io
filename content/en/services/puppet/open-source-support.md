At Open Infrastructure, we offer support to organizations that utilize open
source Puppet to manage their IT infrastructure. Our team of experts has 25+
years of combined experience working with Puppet, and can provide a wide range
of services to help businesses get the most out of this powerful tool.

Our open source Puppet support services include:

**Puppet Installation and Configuration**: We can help your organization with
the installation and configuration of Puppet, including setting up Puppet
servers and agents, deploying Puppet modules, and automating the
configuration of your Puppet infrastructure.

**Puppet Module Development**: Our team can develop custom Puppet modules to
meet the specific needs of businesses and organizations. We are experts in the
Puppet DSL, writing custom functions, types, and providers, and developing spec
and integration tests.

**Puppet Infrastructure Support**: We offer support for the entire Puppet
infrastructure, including Puppetserver, Puppet agents, load balancers,
service discovery, and any other services that reside in the hot path of a
Puppet run.  Our team can help troubleshoot any issues that arise and make
recommendations on changes that will improve the performance of your Puppet
infrastructure.

**Puppet Infrastructure Scaling**: As your organization grows, your Puppet
infrastructure may need to scale up to meet your changing needs. Our team can
provide guidance and support for scaling up your Puppet infrastructure,
including tuning Puppetserver for horizontal or vertical scaling, optimizing
compilation and agent run times, and eliminating common problems that lead to
Puppet-related failures.

**Observability and Alerting**: We can assist your organization in surfacing
observability data from Puppetserver, such as JRuby performance metrics, error
rates, and other indicators of Puppetserver health. By exposing monitoring data
and setting up alerting, we can help you to identify and respond to issues before
they lead to incidents or outages.

**Puppet Maintenance and Upgrades**: Our team can provide ongoing maintenance and
upgrades to ensure that your Puppet infrastructure is up to date and functioning
optimally.

Overall, our open source Puppet support services are designed to help your
organization get the most out of this powerful configuration management
